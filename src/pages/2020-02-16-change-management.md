A friend of mine recently moved to Tampa to take on a role as a "Technology Change & Communications Lead". Her job is Change Management. While I was familiar with the practice of how large companies adopt (or in many cases fail to adopt) sweeping software changes, I hadn't ever considered that it's a full time job.

When a company chooses to purchase SaaS, in order for it to be maximized and that purchase to achieve the most value, that transition has to be managed somehow. Whether moving from one alternative to another, or from using no process to all the sudden using something, it is difficult to learn a new tool for a myriad of reasons. Multiply this across all members of your organization.

Think about the SaaS software you or your company has purchased. Maybe it's a user testing tool, or a project management software. How well do you really know how to use it? Do you love it? How painful would it be to change?

Simply learning that change management in large organizations required dedicated individuals full-time to focus on that process opened my eyes to how much my job as a software developer is also that of a change manager. Because for developers these days, many of the software design choices we make involve introducing open source dependencies, which is akin to SaaS software.

Do I take my changes to the code base seriously with respect to how they are going to impact my colleagues? When introducing a new dependency, or a new utility function even, do I care enough to educate the rest of the team about that design decision, it's pros and cons, and it's future use? How it benefits them? How it might hinder them?

What processes does my organization have for helping me manage change? Am I making decisions in isolation, that if the conversation was being had by a larger number of stakeholders, that decision would change? Am I patient enough to have those conversations before making a decision even if it means I won't get my way?

Here are some principles of Change Management and how they could be applied to life as a software developer.
