In late 2016 and early 2017 I was fortunate enough to give my first conference talks, and I want to keep some info about them here for posterity.

In October 2016 I spoke at [Little Rock Tech Fest](http://www.lrtechfest.com), an extremely fun community-led conference in Arkansas. I decided to talk about the pitfalls of refactoring code, particularly if you are not disciplined in doing so. I called it '"This Code Sucks" and other tales of developer hubris'. Later in February 2017 I gave this talk again at [PyTennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org/) in Nashville, with a few of my code examples ported over to Python rather than JavaScript. [Slides from that talk can be found here](http://russelljanderson.com/refactor-slides/#/). It's a fun talk that I would like to expand and give again, and applies across programming languages to web development in general.

In November of 2017 I spoke at [Nodevember](http://nodevember.org/), an excellent JavaScript conference in my hometown of Nashville. This talk, "Fizz buzzkill - Answering tricky JS interview questions" used a list of made up js interview questions I found as an excuse to talk about some basic JS concepts that can be hard to explain or remember. In fact I should go back and review this talk myself and re-remember some of what I used to know. I had a great time giving this beginner level talk and then discussing the farse that are technical interviews. You can [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMxI8n393ZM&t=5s) or [see the slides here](http://russelljanderson.com/nashjsslides).
